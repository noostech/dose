# Dose

> Your daily dose of structs and functions.

## Features

* Blazingly Fast 🏎💨
* Dependency Injection 💉
* Statically Checked 🕵️‍♀️
* No Runtime Dependency Graph ✨

Unfortunately we do not support runtime dependency cycle detection ... yet.

## Usage

You should call the init macro at the root of your project `lib.rs` to create the trait that will be used by all providers.
This is a current limitation of rust and this may become unnecessary in future versions.

```rust
dose::init!();
```
